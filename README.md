# College_System

This project uses a JavaFX GUI to allow the user to interact with an SQL database.

The user, in the role of a student or teacher, is presented with a GUI and can perform several database manipulations including:

- Add and remove students/teachers from database
- Edit existing information for a student/teacher
- View list of students registered in a certain module or a certain class
- View student grades
- View list of teachers and their details

Below is a sample image showing the GUI and listing the details for a particular student
